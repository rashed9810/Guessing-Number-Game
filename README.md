# Number Guessing Game

A simple number guessing game built using vanilla JavaScript.

## Features

- Two buttons: "Start" and "Restart"
- An input box for the user to enter their guess
- A remaining counter to display the number of guesses left
- A random number (between 1 and 20) is generated and hidden on the client-side
- The user has 3 chances to guess the correct number
- If the user guesses the correct number, a congratulatory pop-up is shown
- If the user fails to guess the correct number within 3 tries, a pop-up message is shown to restart the game
- When the user restarts the game, all values are cleared, and a new random number is selected

## How to Play

1. Click the "Start" button to begin the game.
2. Enter a number between 1 and 20 in the input box.
3. Click the "Submit" button to check your guess.
4. If your guess is correct, a congratulatory pop-up will be shown.
5. If your guess is incorrect, the remaining guess counter will be updated, and you'll have another chance to guess.
6. If you run out of guesses, a pop-up message will be shown, and you can click the "Restart" button to play again.
